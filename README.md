## Scope ##

This is a very simple Vera plugin for the Aviosys IP Power switches

## Features ##

It only supports the 4 channel version, though with a small change to the code it can support the 8 switch device. It supports the following functions:

* Creation of child devices in Vera for each switch channel
* Set each channel on or off from Vera (discrete power)
* Poll the device regularly to determine the actual status

## Usage ##

Create the parent instance and give it the IP address of your AvioSys device. The child devices will be created automatically.

## Limitations ##

It isn't possible to auto detect the number of switch ports (4 or 8) because the 4 port version returns status for the full 8 ports (including the 4 that do not exist).
